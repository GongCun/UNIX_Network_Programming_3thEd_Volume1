* If want to see if the server is busy and need to fork new child to process
* the connection, another apporach is to look at the length of Send-Q & Recv-Q.
* But this approach has two inconveniences:
*
*   1. Parent process can only check the Q-length of listen FD, but the listen FD
*      can't use recv(MSG_PEEK|MSG_DONTWAIT) or ioctl(FIONREAD), these two
*      functions can only use in established FD.
*
*   2. If want to check the Q-length of listen FD, must check the kernel
*      information, and therefore can't be used cross-platform.
*
*      - Linux: check the /proc/*pid*/fd/*fd#* and /proc/net/tcp
*
*      - MaxOS: use proc_pidfdinfo()
*
*      - AIX:   use getprocs() to get the file pointer, then read the socket
*               information from file table entry from /dev/kmem
*
* I just put the key file in the corresponding directory.
